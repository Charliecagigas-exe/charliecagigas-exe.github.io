                    <p>The Beats Fit Pro's manual needed to be corrected due to wasted space, small font, poor contrast, compact text, and missing sections. The redesign was targeted to address issues with overall readability, and aesthetic quality of the manual, while keeping it in the same shape as the original manual that was designed specifically for the product packaging. The app made to control these features is only available on Android, requiring all IOS users to go to their device Bluetooth settings just to control the device. The original manual included the same set of instructions in 4 different languages, leading to issues with understanding the instructions and causing more user frustration. The manual needed a complete overhaul consisting of format, layout, font, and style changes, as well as adding crucial sections users desperately needed.</p>

                        Joy was given the redesigned draft, and the task list was printed out to avoid the same issue from the last test. This allowed the manual to be open the entire time, and this user referenced the manual more times than anyone else.

                        Dr. Jorgensen was not allowed access to the original manual, the drafted manual was provided on a laptop for her to follow along with. The format was difficult to manage, considering the tasks were also on the same laptop. This required the user to go back and forth from task list to manual, and more often than not, the task list was left up, leaving the manual out of sight and unfortunately, out of mind. This was an unfortunate oversight that increased the user’s frustration and could influence the effectiveness of the manual.

                    <p>Many users have difficulty with the placement of the Pairing Additional Devices Section in the iPhone app and device. Additionally, there are several features not mentioned in the manual, such as the fit test, Find My, and the ability to track the location of several beats' models. These features do not require a device to be in Bluetooth range or be connected and would be difficult for users to misplace a device. The most important details to remember when cleaning a device are to avoid damaging it, as well as to ensure it is sport orientated and does not get dirty with sweat, ear wax or dirt. To identify any issues, a troubleshooting section detailing possible issues, their warning signs, and the fix will help prevent users from getting trapped with a non-functioning device. Additionally, a section detailing how to remove the earbud tips would be helpful for users who are not familiar with typical earbuds, as the manual tells the user to select the ear tip that provides the best fit and performance without telling them about the feature in the app to test the fit of the ear-tips.</p>
                    <p>After user testing the device and manual, it was clear that the manual needed to be redesigned. Figma was used to create high-fidelity prototypes to maintain the shape, size, and overall feel of the manual. The original manual came bundled with health and safety warnings as well as a warranty sheet, and a 3-month trial for Apple music. The shape of the manuals was a large consideration during the development of the device, so to avoid requiring a change in packaging during the manufacture process, the same dimensions were kept, the same style paper was used, and the page count was kept to a minimum. Each page on the original manual had the same instruction set in 4 different languages, forcing the text to be much smaller than what would be easy for the normal user to see. The different language instructions were moved to an online format of the manual, organized following beats' website template.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The redesigned manual for the Beats Fit Pro gives the user a much more detailed and enjoyable experience from start to finish. It follows the typical setup procedure and includes instructions for inserting correctly before changing the tip size. Additionally, the device comes with many features that are not mentioned in the manual, such as active noise cancelling, transparency mode, ear tip fit test, voice assistant support and more. If a user does not see instructions on how to use these features, they may feel as if they were lied to and be reluctant to purchase devices from this manufacture in the future. Adding sections covering these features lets the audience know exactly what they get, and users can get the full benefits of the device they purchased.</p>
                    <p>Font size and thickness can be a factor in readability and can be fixed by choosing a thicker weight. Additionally, a section for cleaning the device is important as it shows the user that this type of device needs to be taken care of. Simple instructions and proper materials are important to avoid damage and noting this in the manual will extend the device's lifespan.</p>
