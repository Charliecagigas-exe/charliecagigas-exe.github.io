                <h3>Meknology - The Paladin Project</h3>
                <p>The MeknoMonitor is a monitoring device designed from the ground up to monitor and transmit data collected from sensors regarding the operation of the Paladin – Meknology’s patented technology to sustainably desalinate water. The MeknoMonitor monitors temperature and pressure from critical points in the system to give a readout to users both locally and across the globe. This project was implemented in 3 main sub projects. The monitoring console, the web app monitor, and the Real Time Database (RTDB) hosted on Google’s firebase cloud computing software. </p>

                <h3>Web App</h3>
                <p>The web monitor was an html page that fetched the current readings cyclically using an html-json request. The backend was kept simple to improve access time, and the UI was coherent with the main website identity. </p>

                <h3>Google FireBase Real Time Database</h3>
                <p>Google’s cloud computing software, Firebase, was used to host the database due to its ease of use, overall cost, and it’s integration into our current ecosystem. We considered using other services such as AWS, IBM Cloud, and Azure Cloud, however, after running a cost benefit analysis, service analysis, and integration consideration, we decided to go with Firebase.</p>
